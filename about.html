        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
          As an aspiring software developer in the beautiful city of Austin,
          Texas, I'm passionate about learning software development to create
          innovative and performant solutions. Outside of this new endeavor, I'm
          also a performing musician in the Central Texas area.

        <p class="three-p" id="three-p-1">
          My quest for knowledge has led me to the FullStack JavaScript
          Development Bootcamp at Austin Coding Academy. Expected to graduate in
          the fall of 2023, I have been immersing myself in the world of coding
          to sharpen my technical prowess.

        <p class="three-p">
          Prior to this, I earned a Bachelor of Arts in Music from Texas State
          University, graduating in the summer of 2019. The pursuit of music has
          been a significant part of my life, and has allowed me to foster my
          creativity and personal expression.

        <h3>Industry Experience in Tech</h3>
        <p>
          Prior to joining this bootcamp, I had the opportunity to work with
          Auctane, a cloud-based SaaS company that provides order management
          systems and shipping label solutions. From March 2021 to May 2023, I
          contributed my skills and expertise to their ShipStation and
          ShipEngine brands.

        <p>
          My tenure at Auctane began as a valuable member of the frontline
          support team at ShipStation. Over time, my dedication and passion for
          solving complex problems propelled me to the API support team, where I
          spent the last 11 months of my journey. This L2 support team is
          responsible for troubleshooting and customer inquiry related to
          ShipStation and ShipEngine's REST APIs.
        </p>
        <p>
          During my time in the tech industry, I have gained proficiency in a
          wide range of tools including Postman, JIRA, Sumo Logic, Kibana,
          RedShift, GitHub, and New Relic.

        <h3>Passions and Interests</h3>
        <p>
          From the time I was 16 years old, I always knew that music would be a
          significant part of my life. During my time in college, I was a
          teaching and performing cellist in the Central Texas area. During the
          latter half of my degree, I also decided I'd rather be a jazz pianist
          than a cellist. Since then I've worked very hard at developing this
          skill, and have become a performing pianist in jazz as well as other
          popular styles.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of music, I also like other nerdy things like solving Rubik's
          cubes. I picked up this skill in middle school, and still enjoy this
          hobby for about an hour per week. My fastest solve I've ever timed was
          at about 27.5 seconds. Since picking up the hobby again in 2020, the
          fastest solve I've timed was about 31 seconds, and I hope to beat my
          previous record one day.
